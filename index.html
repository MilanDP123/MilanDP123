                <h6>StudyStack Pro</h6>
                <p>This is my first full project/app. I made this app when I was 17 years old. The reason I made this app was to make it easier for myself to study languages, but it didn't help much because I was too busy most of the time working on the app instead of studying. I used some inspiration from Quizlet, began from scratch and gave it my own touch. When I started this project, I knew almost nothing about JavaScript, but I learned a lot during this project. First I just wanted to make a website, but later I turned it into a desktop app because I found it easier to share with other people. Please enjoy it.</p>
