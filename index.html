                <h4>About me</h4>
                <p>My name is Milan, and I am now 17 years old (born in 2006). I live in Belgium (Flanders). I started my programming journey when I was around 13 years old. Since then, I have learned Python at school and I taught myself HTML, CSS and JS. Currently, I am learning Java at school.</p>
                <p>If you find a bug in one of my projects or have a suggestion, please contact me.</p>
                <p>You can contact me via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milandepaepe123/" id="insta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a id="discord" onclick="copyToClipboard()">Discord</a> (click to copy my username) or via mail at "projectsmilan@gmail.com".</p>

                        <h6>StudyStack Pro</h6>
                        <p>This is my first full project/app. I made this app when I was 17 years old. The reason I made this app was to make it easier for myself to study languages, but it didn't help much because I was too busy most of the time working on the app instead of studying. I used some inspiration from Quizlet, began from scratch and gave it my own touch. When I started this project, I knew almost nothing about JavaScript, but I learned a lot during this project. First I just wanted to make a website, but later I turned it into a desktop app because I found it easier to share with other people. Please enjoy it.</p>
