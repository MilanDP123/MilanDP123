        <h4>Blog</h4>
        <p>This is my personal blog where I will post regular updates on my programming journey. I started this on
            23/09/2023 and hope to keep this blog alive.</p>

                <p>I started with the first challenge for 30 days of JavaScript. I hope to reach the end and learn a lot
                    of new ways to code in JS. The ultimate goal is to improve my JS skills to a level where I can code
                    everything I want without needing to look everything up. I think I will keep adding things to this
                    site until I have improved a lot and then make a new, better one.</p>

                <h5>24/09/2023</h5>
                <p>Today I made a better header and fixed some sizing issues. I like how it turned out. I came up with
                    some simple project ideas that I will work on in the next few days. The first of them I already
                    finished, it is called 'Higher or Lower'. The game is super simple, but it took me a bit longer than
                    I expected to make. The biggest challenge was to make the pictures of playingcards to appear.</p>

                <h5>23/09/2023</h5>
                <p>I finally managed to upload this website and start this blog. It took me a few frustrating days, but
                    I'm happy it all works now. Today I also finished my second project (password generator). This took
                    me only a few minutes, but I think it will be very useful. I just need to add a way to save the
                    passwords, because they are quite hard to remember.</p>
