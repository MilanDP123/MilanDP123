        <p>This is my personal blog where I will post regular updates on my programming journey. I started this on 23/09/2023 and hope to keep this blog alive.</p>

                <p>Today I finally managed to upload this website and start this blog. It took me a few frustrating days, but I'm happy it all works now. Today I also finished my second project (password generator). This took me only a few minutes, but I think it will be very useful. I just need to add a way to save the passwords, because they are quite hard to remember.</p>
