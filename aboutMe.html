        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>My name is Milan, and I am now 17 years old (born in 2006). I live in Belgium (Flanders). I started my
            programming journey when I was around 13 years old. Since then, I have learned Python at school and I taught
            myself HTML, CSS and JS. Currently, I am learning Java at school.</p>
        <p>If you find a bug in one of my projects or have a suggestion, please contact me.</p>
        <p>You can contact me via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milandepaepe123/" id="insta" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a id="discord" onclick="copyToClipboard()">Discord</a> (click
            to copy my username) or via mail at "milandepaepe@icloud.com".</p>
        <p>My hobbies are golf and cycling. I started golf in August 2023 and my current handicap is 33.2. When the
            weather is good, which doesn't happen often in Belgium, I like to ride my racing bike.</p>
        <p>I really like F1. I try to watch every grand prix, but this is sometimes quite difficult because some races
            are really early, but almost every one has this problem, so it isn't that bad. Not only that, but I also
            like to watch cycling races and football. I have played football myself for over 10 years.</p>
