        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>My name is Milan, and I am now 17 years old (born in 2006). I live in Belgium (Flanders). I started my programming journey when I was around 13 years old. Since then, I have learned Python at school and I taught myself HTML, CSS and JS. Currently, I am learning Java at school.</p>
        <p>If you find a bug in one of my projects or have a suggestion, please contact me.</p>
        <p>You can contact me via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milandepaepe123/" id="insta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a id="discord" onclick="copyToClipboard()">Discord</a> (click to copy my username) or via mail at "projectsmilan@gmail.com".</p>
        <p>My hobbies are golf and cycling. I started golf in August 2023 and my current handicap is 53, so I can still improve a lot. When the weather is good, which doesn't happen often in Belgium, I like to ride my racing bike.</p>
        <p>I really like F1. I try to watch every grand prix, but this is sometimes quite difficult because some races are really early, but almost every one has this problem, so it isn't that bad. Not only that, but I also like to watch cycling races and football. I have played football myself for over 10 years.</p>
